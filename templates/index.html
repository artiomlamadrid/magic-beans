                <h4>Valuation Models Used in Magic Beans</h4>
                <p><strong>Magic Beans</strong> uses several industry-standard quantitative models to estimate the fair value of stocks. All models are fully automated and use parameters derived from real Yahoo Finance data.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</strong><br>
                        <em>Purpose:</em> Estimates the present value of a company based on projected future free cash flows.<br>
                        <em>Key Parameters:</em>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Free Cash Flow (FCF) Growth Rate:</strong> Calculated from historical FCF trends or sector averages.</li>
                            <li><strong>Projection Period:</strong> 5-10 years (configurable, default: 5 years).</li>
                            <li><strong>Terminal Value:</strong> Uses the Gordon Growth Model with a conservative perpetual growth rate (default: 2%).</li>
                            <li><strong>Discount Rate:</strong> Default 8% (can be adjusted for risk or sector).</li>
                            <li><strong>Shares Outstanding:</strong> Pulled from latest company data.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <em>Logic:</em> FCF is projected forward, discounted to present value, and summed with terminal value. The result is divided by shares outstanding to estimate fair value per share.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mt-3">
                        <strong>Dividend Discount Model (DDM)</strong><br>
                        <em>Purpose:</em> Values a stock based on the present value of expected future dividends.<br>
                        <em>Key Parameters:</em>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dividend Growth Rate:</strong> Estimated from historical dividend increases.</li>
                            <li><strong>Discount Rate:</strong> Default 7% (can be adjusted).</li>
                            <li><strong>Projection Period:</strong> 5-10 years (default: 5 years).</li>
                            <li><strong>Terminal Value:</strong> Based on a perpetual growth model (default: 2%).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <em>Logic:</em> Projects future dividends, discounts them to present value, and adds a terminal value for perpetuity.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mt-3">
                        <strong>P/E Analysis (Earnings Multiple)</strong><br>
                        <em>Purpose:</em> Estimates fair value based on justified Price/Earnings ratios.<br>
                        <em>Key Parameters:</em>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Trailing and Forward EPS:</strong> Pulled from company data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Justified P/E Ratio:</strong> Based on sector averages and company growth rates.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <em>Logic:</em> Multiplies EPS by justified P/E to estimate fair value. Adjusts for sector premium if applicable.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mt-3">
                        <strong>Hypergrowth/Platform Scaling Models</strong><br>
                        <em>Purpose:</em> For high-growth tech stocks, applies exponential growth and platform scaling logic.<br>
                        <em>Key Parameters:</em>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Growth Rate:</strong> Based on recent revenue/FCF acceleration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Discount Rate:</strong> Higher to reflect risk (default: 10-12%).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <em>Logic:</em> Uses exponential DCF and scenario analysis to capture upside potential.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5 class="mt-4">Parameter Sources & Adjustments</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>All parameters are derived from the latest Yahoo Finance data for each ticker.</li>
                    <li>Defaults are chosen for conservatism but can be adjusted in code for advanced users.</li>
                    <li>Terminal values use the Gordon Growth Model with a low perpetual growth rate to avoid overestimation.</li>
                    <li>Discount rates are set based on market conditions and sector risk.</li>
